Memory: Assignment # 5
Purpose: The purpose of this program is to simulate computer memory.
It contains functions to store and retrieve ints to and from memory
locations as well as a funtion to copy a block of memory to another
location and a funtion to dump with contents of a specified block of
memory. This one includes a series of overloaded operators to add 
together, assign one memory to equal another, check if two memory 
equal eachother, and output a memory with cout.



Comments: Its working with all the funtions except the overloaded [] operator where 
we are supposed to be able to use that to store a value in a memory location.
My problem with it was that i couldnt figure out how to access the value to be assigned to 
the location since making the operator overloading funtion only seemed to give me access
to the memory being accessed and the location where i was to put the value

Also it works with my driver but will likely crash with yours, i found my overloaded
assignment operator will only work if i am assigning one memory to another memory that
already exists. So it wont work for memory c = a; but will work for memory c; c=a; 

Lastly, my .h file worked good with code block but the compiler here at the college is complain
about it :/

Aside from that I think my funtions work good.
